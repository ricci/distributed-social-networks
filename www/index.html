        This page measures the concentration of user data on the <a
          href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a>, the <a
          href="https://atproto.com/">Atmosphere</a>, and public git forges according to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">Herfindahl–Hirschman
        Index</a> (HHI) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Shannon_index">Shannon Index</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        HHI is an indicator from economics used to measure competition between firms in
        an industry.
        Mathematically, HHI is the sum of the squares of market shares of all servers.
        Values close to zero indicate perfectly competitive markets (eg. many servers, with users
        spread evenly), while values close to 10000 indicate highly concentrated monopolies (eg.
        most users on a single server). In economics, values below 100 are considered
        "Highly Competitive", below 1500 is "Unconcentrated", and above 2500 is
        considered "Highly Concentrated".
      </p>

      <p>
        The Shannon Index is an entropy-based measure used in ecological studies.
        It is computed the same as Shannon entropy using the natural log: the negative sum over all servers of the "market
        share" times the log of the market share. Lower values indicate lower entropy (a high concentration of one species),
        while higher values indicate a more even population. In this context,
        the maximum value is the number of servers, which would mean that all servers have equal population.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the social networks, this site currently measures the concentration of user data for active users: in the
        Fediverse, this data is on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/#server-to-server-interactions">servers</a> (also known as instances);
        in the Atmosphere, it is on the
        <a
          href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server">PDSes</a>
        that host users' <a
          href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#data-repo">data repos</a>.
        All PDSes run by the company Bluesky Social PBC are aggregated in this
        dataset, since they are under the control of a single entity. Similarly,
        mastodon.social and mastodon.online are combined as they are run by the
        same company.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the public git forges, this site uses the number of "origins" of type "git" archived
        by <a href="https://softwareheritage.org">Software Heritage</a>; this is
        roughly equivalent to the number of git repositories they crawl. Software
        Heritage's archive coverage can be found on <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/">their coverage page</a>.

      </p>

      <p>
        The location of user data is not the only interesting measure of 
        centralization. On a technical level, there is the network
        structure (peer to peer, relays, etc.), identity management, the
        infrastructure on which it is hosted, etc. On a legal level, there are
        issues regarding the jurisdictions where servers are located, companies
        are located, etc. On a social level, there are issues around where
        human power is concentrated in and on the platform, and whether that
        power is disproportionately held by certain groups. If you would like
        to help contribute other measures of decentralization, get in touch.
