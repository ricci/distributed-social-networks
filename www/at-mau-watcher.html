        <h3>Operation</h3>

            This service watches for records created by accounts - these records includes posts, "likes", following or
            unfollowing other accounts, blocking other accounts, etc. It only records the most recent time each account
            was seen, its handle, and which <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server">PDS</a> the account resides on. It does not record contents of posts,
            which posts were liked, etc.
        </p>
